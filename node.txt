Day 1(26/12/24):
The Last Week of My Web Development Journey
Last week, I felt very sad because I was under a lot of pressure while working on the JavaScript capstone project. It was my first time doing a capstone, collaborating with a partner, and using GitHub—all of these were completely new experiences for me. Through this process, I came to understand the immense(bao la) pressure that IT professionals must endure(chịu đựng) and why they are paid such high salaries. They spend countless(vô số) hours working with computers every day and put in tremendous(to lớn) effort to think of solutions to fix bugs and tackle the problems they encounter(bắt gặp).
During my studies, there were moments when I wanted to give up and allow myself to relax. However, I kept reminding myself to push through these challenges. I realized that overcoming difficulties now will give me the strength and resilience(sự kiên cường) I need to face the real world when I start working.
Currently, I am continuing to learn React and practice algorithms on LeetCode. Additionally, during my free time, I am working hard to improve my English skills. I believe that mastering English will help me grow both personally and professionally in the future.
Day 2(27/12/24):
During my journey of learning web development, I have come to realize many things that I hadn’t noticed before. First, I have started focusing on more important aspects(khía cạnh) of my life. I no longer spend hours playing games or watching YouTube late at night. Instead, I dedicate(cống hiến:dành thời gian) my time to studying web development, improving my English, and practicing algorithms on LeetCode. These activities leave me with little free time to think about anything unrelated(không liên quan) to my goals. Day by day, I strive(phấn đấu) to develop myself as quickly as possible.
Second, this process has significantly upgraded my skills and equipped me with valuable knowledge about web development. At just 18 years old, I feel proud of myself because I am preparing for an internship next year, with the possibility of working professionally by my second or third year in university.
Finally, this journey has taught me patience and perseverance(kiên trì) on the path I have chosen. I know that learning programming is challenging, but I have never considered giving up because I am determined to achieve my goals. I promise myself to stay disciplined(kỷ luật) every day and not quit, as I am getting closer to success. After all, there is no place for laziness on the road to achieving great things.
Day 3(29/12/24):
During my journey of learning web development as a freshman(sinh viên năm nhất), I chose a unique path for myself by deciding to specialize(chuyên môn hóa) in web development as early as possible. Although I could have focused on studying general subjects at school to compete for scholarships(học bổng), I decided to learn coding early, hoping that these practical skills would greatly benefit me during the job application process.
Some people might say that I am overthinking(lo xa) because I am only a freshman and have started learning programming(lập trình) so early. However, I do not see it that way. My field(lĩnh vực) is rapidly growing and becoming more competitive every day, leaving no room for individuals(cá nhân) without experience. Large tech companies now prefer hiring candidates(ứng viên) with two to three years of experience, as they do not want to spend time training employees from scratch(từ đầu).
I completely agree with this perspective(quan điểm) because if I succeed in interviews, I want to be ready to start working immediately without requiring extensive(chuyên sâu) training. By building my skills now, I believe I am preparing myself for a competitive job market and increasing my chances of landing(đạt được) my dream role in the future.
Day 4 (31/12/2024 - The last day of the year)
In recent days, I have been feeling very lazy and undisciplined with myself. For instance, yesterday I didn’t study anything or complete my homework for Cybersoft. This even led the admin to remind me that if I keep being so lazy, it will be difficult for me to graduate from the frontend course and secure a high-paying job in my field.
I sincerely(trân trọng) apologize to myself for pampering(nuông chiều) my laziness. Starting today, I will regain my discipline and strive to study productively. Here are the goals I have set for myself:
By February next year, I aim to complete all the documentation on Tailwind, CSS, Bootstrap, and HTML. (In the frontend course, I fell behind on these two topics, so I am currently unable to code a beautiful user interface for myself.) My objective(mục tiêu khách quan) is to be able to create a visually appealing(hấp dẫn) UI.
By March next year, I will improve my English skills to a basic conversational level. This will help me understand technical terms in my field, communicate effectively with clients, and acquire(giành được) the knowledge needed to write a professional CV when applying for web development positions.
From that point, I plan to work as a freelancer while also interning at Cybersoft to gain practical experience in the frontend field.
I believe in myself—I have said it, and I will achieve it. Let’s not let ourselves fall into darkness; instead, let’s rise up(đứng lên) and strive for success.
Day 5(1/1/2025 - The first day of the new year):
Today is the first day of the year, and I’d like to take a moment(dành một chút thời gian) to reflect(phản ánh) on the past year with you. Like many others, people might create a video to look back(nhìn lại) on their lives over the past year. However, I chose a different way—I decided to pour(trải lòng) my heart into this diary.
Looking back, the past year was perhaps the most transformative year of my life. I started as a carefree(vô tư) boy, not overthinking much. However, some major shocks(những cú sốc) came into my life and completely knocked me down(đánh ngã tôi). Yet, that boy never gave up when faced(đối mặt) with challenges. Those difficulties didn’t break him; instead, they made him stronger and more determined(quyết tâm) to strive for a better version of himself.
Over the months, I’ve grown more mature, realizing what truly matters to me and learning to be more disciplined with myself each day. I’m genuinely(thực sự) grateful(biết ơn) for everything that happened, as it shaped(hình thành) who I am today.
For this new year, I wish for myself to become even more mature in my thoughts, bolder(mạnh dạn) in pursuing(theo đuổi) the things I love, and more loving towards myself. Last year was incredibly(thật ko thể tin) tough(khó khăn), and I didn’t have the means(điều kiện) to take care of myself properly(tử tế)—I even kept wearing old, torn clothes. Looking back, I feel proud of myself for enduring(chịu đựng) it all and not giving up(bỏ cuộc).
Finally, I wish myself continuous growth(phát triển) and improvement(cải thiện) in this new year. I also hope that the boy from the past will achieve(đạt được) everything he dreams of in the days to come.
Day 6(2/1/2025 - My birthday):
Today is a very special day because it is my birthday. There are some thoughts I would like to share. Today, I finally expressed(bày tỏ) my feelings to a close friend from my middle school days. She is probably the person I have opened(nói ra lòng mình) up to the most in the past two or three months.
Since becoming a freshman in university, I have distanced(cô lập) myself from the outside world. I often feel that no one shares the same thoughts or is on the same wavelength(tần số) as me. I also feel that people cannot truly understand my circumstances(trường hợp), so they are unable(không thể) to connect with my inner(bên trong) world.
However, I have always felt there was something special between me and her. Since I moved to Ho Chi Minh City to study, she has never dated anyone or shown feelings for anyone else. I don’t want to sound narcissistic, but I can sense(cảm nhận) it.
In life, there are things we don’t realize we’ll regret until it’s too late—like letting someone important slip away(vuột mất). However, my standards(tiêu chuẩn) for a girlfriend have changed a lot compared to before. Now, I hope to meet someone who is capable of handling both financial responsibilities and taking care of a family. Of course, I also need to work hard to become the kind of person who can match that standard.
Maybe I’ll never meet someone who perfectly fits this image(tưởng tượng), but I still hope to find someone like that one day. In the meantime(trong lúc đóh), I need to focus on improving myself to become the best version of me.
On this birthday, I wish myself more luck in the coming year, more self-love, and a reminder to never forget that my family will always be there for me when I face challenges in life.
Day 7 (3/1/2025)
It’s 2:12 a.m., and I still cannot close my eyes to sleep. Maybe I’m worried about whether(liệu-) I will achieve the goals I’ve set for the new year. So, I decided to get up and continue studying. I always try to complete my goals as soon as possible. For example, today I need to work on all four English skills:
Writing: I write daily blogs and upload them to my GitHub
Speaking: I use an app called The Coach to practice speaking. It’s a great app because it corrects my pronunciation errors and helps me form longer sentences with two or three ideas.
Listening: I watch FreeCodeCamp tutorials on YouTube about learning ReactJS through(thông qua) small projects.
Reading and Vocabulary: I study at CyberEnglish, a course I received as a bonus when I enrolled(tham gia) in the Frontend course at CyberSoft.
Moreover, tomorrow I need to review the recorded lesson from my Frontend course because yesterday was my birthday, and I missed the class. I will also try to solve some algorithm problems on LeetCode since I haven’t touched(đụng vào) them this week.
In the evening, I’ll meet a friend to exchange ideas and learn more about our field. Although it might seem like a casual hangout(tụ tập), I want our conversation to focus on our studies and industry knowledge.
Since I have so many tasks tomorrow, I’m writing this blog tonight to reduce the pressure for the next day. I might wake up late, but I’ll do my best not to let that happen. Sleep and work are two separate things, and I won’t let them overlap(chồng chéo).
Day 8 (4/1/2025):
Yesterday, I couldn’t complete one thing I had planned, which was to rewatch the recording of last Thursday's ReactJS lesson. Additionally(ngoài ra), I felt quite disappointed about the hangout with my friends. The reason is that our conversation didn’t revolve(xoay quanh) around topics related to our field of study. I noticed that my friends approach learning in a superficial(hời hợt) way. They heavily rely on ChatGPT to support them, often copying code directly without fully understanding it. When I asked them questions, they didn’t seem to know the answers.
This realization has made me more confident in my own progress(tiến bộ). I’ve learned significantly more specialized knowledge compared to them. Despite that disappointment, I was extremely happy because yesterday, I solved three problems on LeetCode. More importantly, I solved them independently, without needing to refer to others’ solutions. I even came up(đưa ra) with my own design solutions and have gained a deeper understanding of concepts like space(không gian) complexity and time complexity.
Day by day, as I continue to improve my skills, I feel optimistic about my future. I work harder than many others—while they only focus on studying at school and learning English, I go the extra mile by studying data structures and algorithms (DSA) as well as programming. This extra effort has helped me grow into a more mature person.
Now, I understand that programming is a field that demands a lot of time and dedication, leaving little room for maintaining relationships. For this reason, I’ve decided to prioritize my personal and professional development before considering getting into a romantic relationship. After my previous relationship, I’ve become more withdrawn. However, I hope that the next person who comes into my life will be someone who can truly care for me, understand my situation, and empathize with my circumstances.
Day 9(5/1/2025):
Today, I have finally completed the goals I set for this week. Every day, I write a blog in English as my diary to practice my writing skills. This week, I managed(quản lý) to solve seven problems on LeetCode. Moreover, the admin of Cybersoft provided me with additional(bổ sung) materials(nguyên vật liệu) to practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). These materials include pre-selected(được chọn trước) problems that are often used by companies in interviews for candidates. Besides, I also received documents on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which are very helpful for me as references(tham khảo).
Sometimes, I feel very lonely because no one studies with me. However, I believe that if you want to stand in a position where no one else can, you must endure feelings that no one else dares(dám) to face. If there were an easy way for everyone to succeed, perhaps no one would be unemployed or without work. I trust that time will reveal(phơi bày) the results of my efforts, and one day, others will see the fruits of my hard work.
I hope to inspire(truyền cảm hứng) others with my passion and dedication, spreading this fire of enthusiasm to the people around me and the generations to come.
For the upcoming Lunar New Year, I am considering(xem xét) curling my hair to look more handsome, but I’m still hesitant since I haven't received my Tet bonus yet.
Next week, I need to focus more on preparing for my final exams at school. There are five subjects to cover: Calculus(giải tích), Linear Algebra(Đại số tuyến tính), Philosophy(triết học), Basic Computer Science, and Physical Education. I already have a detailed(chi tiết) schedule and plan in mind(trong tâm trí)—now it’s time to put it into action. Throughout this semester, I have devoted(tận tâm) most of my time to learning programming. Therefore, next week, I will spend more time on general subjects to achieve good results in my exams.
Day 10(6/1/2025):
These days, I find it very difficult to fall asleep. I keep thinking about my future, wondering where I will go and who I will become. Every night, I feel quite lonely—not because I don't have a girlfriend, but because I feel like there’s no real joy in my life. During these moments, I usually listen to music to comfort myself and eat my favorite foods to regain(lấy lại) some energy.
Interestingly, since I started learning programming, I have been eating more and have even gained some weight—something I couldn’t do before. While studying programming, I don’t have to restrict(hạn chế) myself from eating certain foods, except fast food. This makes my diet very flexible, and I can enjoy eating whatever I like without worrying too much.
Day by day, I’ve realized many wonderful things from those around me. One thing that inspires me in life is a Thai movie called Fire Rose. The film tells the story of a love between a police officer and a robber(tên cướp). Even though they stand on opposite sides, the movie suggests that if two people keep thinking about each other, even parallel lines will eventually intersect(giao nhauk).
This thought motivates me to try harder every day because I believe that as long as I keep striving, my efforts will be rewarded. Tomorrow, I am determined to study even more and work towards achieving the goals I’ve set for myself this weekend.
Day 11(7/1/2025):
Today, I reviewed my calculus subject. I noted down several areas I need to focus on, as listed below:
First, regarding integrals, I realized I still struggle(vật lộn) to recall(nhớ lại) all the formulas(công thức) for antiderivatives(nguyên hàm) and definite(xác định) integrals(tích phân). I am particularly weak in solving problems involving special formulas like those related to arctanx and trigonometric(lượng giác) functions (sinx,cosx). Additionally, there are some unfamiliar theorems(định lý) I had never encountered(đối mặt) before. The most challenging part for me is definitely integrals, so I plan to dedicate more time to practicing problems in this area.
So far(cho đến nay), I have solved 25 questions from the sample test. My batch(lớpb) is special because we are required to take multiple-choice(trắc nghiệm) exams, so the exact format of the final test is still uncertain(ko chắc chắn). Tomorrow morning, I will focus on reviewing linear algebra(ĐSTT), and in the afternoon, I have a session where my teacher will guide us through solving sample multiple-choice questions. I am determined to do my best.
Tonight, I will review the recording from last Thursday's lecture(bài giảng), which I missed due to my birthday celebration. In addition, I plan to solve one LeetCode problem from the document provided by the admin of Cybersoft. If time permits, I will also practice my listening and speaking skills using the Elsa Speaking app before going to bed.
Even though my schedule is busier than before, I am striving to maintain my daily English learning habit(thói quen). I find that when I manage my time well and fully(đầy đủ) commit to tasks, I can work more productively.
Regarding calculus, I still have 15 remaining(còn lại) questions to solve. I will tackle them on Wednesday morning and then search for more practice materials(tài liệu) to strengthen(củng cố) my understanding. My goal is to pass the course and enjoy a peaceful and fulfilling(hoàn thành) Tet holiday with my family.
Today, I also received my salary, and I have already used part of it to register for the Node.js and Node.js Advanced courses at Cybersoft. These courses will help me enhance my backend development skills and take another step(bước thêm 1 bước nữa) towards becoming a full-stack developer.
This is just the beginning of my journey in programming, and I hope to maintain my energy and enthusiasm for learning in the future.
Day 12(8/1/2024):
Today, I woke up later than I had expected, as I got up at 11 a.m. As a result, I couldn’t review Linear Algebra in the morning. However, after the teacher reviewed the exam at the beginning of the afternoon, I managed to go over a lot of the material. I noticed that I am still struggling with chapters 5 and 6, which cover Linear Mapping(ánh xạ) and Quadratic(toàn phương) Forms in Euclidean Space. However, overall, I feel confident with the exam. I just need to review the missing lessons, rewrite my notes, and practice more. I believe I can pass this subject with my current effort.
I also came up with some methods to speed up my calculations during the multiple-choice section. For easier questions, I can solve them quickly without wasting much time, saving time for the more challenging questions. My teacher mentioned(đề cập) that the multiple-choice section will not focus on very advanced topics but will mostly test basic foundational knowledge.
The matrix(ma trận) part of the subject is what I find most challenging, so I plan to review matrix operations(phép toán), particularly(cụ thể,) the inverse matrix and matrix rank, to apply them to chapter 4, which covers Linear Equations(phương trình) and the conditions for having solutions. If I had to choose, I think Linear Algebra is easier to learn than Calculus. Today, I solved 40 questions in just two hours, while yesterday, I spent 3 hours solving only 25 questions in Calculus, and I felt exhausted(kiệt sức) afterward.
Additionally, my teacher provided us with a website to practice multiple-choice questions. I will make sure to use it to improve further and perform well on the exam.
Moreover, today I learned how to use AI Copilot to assist me in coding faster and more conveniently than coding manually(thủ công). Many people who are not as advanced in the field as I am have told me that the web development industry will collapse(sập) in the coming years. They also said things like, "Building a website for a client will only earn you 700,000 VND, while studying costs hundreds of millions." These comments are meant to discourage(làm nản lòng) me, but I will not give up because of such negativity(tiêu cực).
Day 13(9/1/2024):
Today was not particularly special. At work, there are some people who frequently(thường xuyên) quiz(kiểm tra) others about whether they remember the charts. They think that knowing all the charts makes them very competent(có năng lực), but I don't share the same opinion.
I work primarily(chủ yếu) to earn money to pay for my programming studies, and I’ve shared this perspective(quan điểm) with others. However, it seems like no one pays much attention to what I say. I believe that only those who have long-term goals and aspire(khao khát) to hold high positions at Sasin would place great importance on such small details. I understand that success starts from mastering small things, but maybe my perspective makes me appear disagreeable(khó chịu) to some people.
That being said, I have my own way of thinking, and only I truly understand it. I consider learning the charts as something I can do in my free time because I need to devote most of my energy to studying programming. If I focus, I believe I can accomplish(hoàn thành) anything—not because I lack the ability(khả năng), but because I prioritize my goals.
Perhaps in the future, when I achieve success, I will reflect(phản ánh) on the people around me. Those who weren’t there for me during my struggles won’t deserve(xứng đáng) to stand by me during my triumphs(chiến thắng). As the saying goes, "Birds of a feather flock(đàn) together."
Today, I also said something that I probably shouldn’t have: "A man who pays for everything is foolish(ngu si)." My intention(ý định) wasn’t to insult(sỉ nhục) anyone but to express a deeper(sâu sắc) thought. When I had money and was generous with it, people stayed by my side. But when I faced difficulties, focusing on my studies and work, they accused me of neglecting(sao nhãng) them and eventually left
Day 14(10/1/2024):
Today is a day when I had a lot of time, but I don’t know why I ended(cuối cùng) up doing so little work. Maybe it’s because I wasn’t able to fully concentrate on my tasks. This morning, I completed my React homework, which was coding the ShoesStore. However, I still tried to make the most of my time learning, so I had to stay up late tonight to achieve my goals for the day.
Sometimes, when I work too much, I feel a sense of emptiness(trống rỗng) on the days when I don’t have much to do. It makes me feel bored. I have my final exam schedule already, and I’ve decided that tomorrow morning I will study linear algebra and in the afternoon, I will review calculus to quickly go over the material and aim for a good result in the exam.
There are days when I feel like my mind is blank(trống rỗng), not knowing what to do because of the pressure from everything around me. But I always try to stay positive, so people around me think I’m doing fine. However, as humans, everyone has moments of weakness. If I succeed in the future, I will be proud of myself, looking back at the difficult days when I felt so negative that I could silently(thầm) cry, overwhelmed(choáng ngợp) by the amount of studying and pressure from all sides. Anyone who wants to succeed must go through stages like this, and I am no exception(ngoại lệ).
Day 15(12/1/2025):
Today marks(đánh dấu) the end of my weekend. Over the past few days, I haven't had time to continue writing my blog because I needed to focus on preparing for my final exams and taking some rest. I had a conversation with my sister about the upcoming Lunar New Year. She asked me if I had money to buy new clothes for Tet. I told her that I wouldn’t be going out much, so I didn’t need to buy anything, and I wasn’t planning to visit my hometown either.
However, deep down, I know that everyone wishes to return to their hometown, especially during Tet, to reunite with family and celebrate in the place where they grew up. This year, I’ll just be working and then coming home to study programming, improve my English, and practice data structures and algorithms.
I told my sister that I plan to start an internship in March, and honestly(thành thật mà nói), I feel quite anxious about it because I’m not sure if I’ll pass the interviews. Despite this fear, I’m determined to do my best and achieve the goals I’ve set for myself. My sister laughed when I told her this, but I confidently said that investing(đầu tư) in my education now will eventually pay off(trả hết), even if I don’t see the results immediately.
I truly believe in my words because starting early gives me an advantage. More importantly, I genuinely(thực sự) enjoy learning programming—not just because it promises high salaries or good job opportunities, but because I love the process itself. I’ve also come to understand that higher salaries come with greater competition in this field.
Right now, I can’t call myself a "master" like the senior developers out there, but I’m working hard to improve my skills as much as possible. During this Tet, my focus will be on improving my English and enhancing(nâng cao) my understanding of data structures and algorithms to better prepare for my internship.
Of course, this means I’ll have to endure some feelings of loneliness while others are celebrating Tet. But I won’t let that bother(bận tâm) me; instead, I’ll try to maintain positive energy and stay motivated(động lực). I firmly(chắc chắn) believe that my hard work and effort to learn will be the greatest gift I can give to myself.
Day 16(13/1/2025):
Today, I completed the first day of my final exams and achieved results beyond(vượt xa) my expectations in Calculus and Linear Algebra. Considering that I spent most of this semester learning programming, simply passing these subjects was already the outcome I had hoped for. Now, I will sit down to review and prepare thoroughly for tomorrow’s exam in Fundamental Informatics.
There is a saying that you will never know your true potential(tiềm năng) until you push yourself to the limit. Do you think this statement is true? As for me, I completely agree with it, and I’d like to share my thoughts on this.
In my view, each person’s potential is an unknown variable—no one truly knows their limits, including me. There have been times when I achieved the daily goals I set for myself but still felt that I could have accomplished even more. There are people who go far beyond their goals every day, and only by doing so do they achieve success. Reflecting on(suy ngẫm) this, I realized that I want to be like them—to set more ambitious(tham vọng) goals for myself and continuously strive to improve, rather than just being satisfied with completing my initial objectives.
For instance, I want to become proficient(thành thạo) in English so that I can communicate and work in an international environment. To achieve this, I need to dedicate a significant amount of time to practicing writing, speaking, and understanding how things work in such settings. Improving my English skills involves not only writing blogs, learning new vocabulary, and practicing speaking through apps but also preparing for IELTS tests, writing essays(bài luận) on various topics in English, and listening to podcasts daily to get familiar with the language. Similarly(tương tự), in programming, I need to code more frequently to enhance my logical thinking and problem-solving skills.
Day 17(20/1/2025):
Fresh water is a limited resource in some parts of the world. Today, increasing demand made it a global
problem. What are the causes? What are the solutions?
In some regions around the world, water scarcity has become a prevalent issue that negatively affects many individuals.
In this day and age, with the surging demand for fresh water, it has become a global problem.
Although water scarcity has long been a major issues in some regions around the world, it has become much more
serious due to the increasing demand for fresh water.In this essay, I would explore the reasons behind the issue before proposing
some effective solutions that can handle it.
1.Topic sentence: There are some reasons that explain why lack of fresh water has become a major global issue around the world. As the world pollution has increased/Although
uncontrollably and continously reached a new peak, many industrial and agricultural activities have been intensified, leading to pollution. Eventually
, fresh water becomes contaminated, limiting access to it and leading to water scarcity. Also, as more people require fresh water, its demand has become too
much for the current supply to handle, worsening the lack of fresh water on an international scale. /Although the overall amount
of water around the world has not diminished, fresh water become less accessible due to pollution from industrial and agricultural activities. 
Unfortunately, as the international population soars uncontrollably, the demand surges, making it hard for many groups of people to get a hold
of comsumable water.
2.Despite the severity of this issue, there are some effective solutions that can be applied for handling it effectively.First and foremost, applying modern technology to create
sustainable solutions for industrial and agricultural activities is highly important as the supply of food and products can be kept without leading to more harmful wastewater being discharged
.Furthermore, improved water-treating plants should be applied more widely, which can be used to filter water on even remove salt from ocean water to increase the overall supply.
With these approaches, human beings around the world may not have to face water scarcity in the future more /First and foremost, sustainable practices should
be applied in agricultural and industrial production, which helps limit the amounts of harmful wastewater being discharged. Also, the goverment should invest in improving the
quality of water-treating plants, helping it filter water more effectively and improve the level of supply for fresh water.
3.In conclusion, as the issue of water shortage becomes more prevalent, many reasons behind it have been explored, including pollution and increasing population sizes.
In order to handle this issue effectively, we must focus on using technology to handle wastewater, while the goverment must focus more on creating and applying modern water treatment plants
Day 18(24/1/2025):
In the future, it seems it will be more difficult to live on the Earth. Some people think more money
should be spent on researching other planets to live, such as Mars. To what extent do you agree or disagree
with this statement.
Some expectations point out that living on this planet would become more challenging in the future, prompting
people to suggest that investing in learning about other habitable planets is beneficial and should be conducted.
Personally, I totally agree with this suggestion based on some reasons that are explained in this essay.
On the other hand, there are some reasons that explain why there is an actual demand for learning about new planet as the
future of Each face some uncertainty. As human beings have relied on fossil fuel for energy in the past century, the amount
of greenhouse gases being realeased has reached an alarming level. As these emissions trap solar heat, our planet gradually becomes
warmer, making many habitable locations become degraded or destroued. Thus, there is an actual possibility that our planet 
would become inhabitable, and we should learn about other locations in the universe for future generations.
On the other hand, the idea of migrating to another planet once our planet becomes inhabitable is unrealistic from mutiple perspective.
First and foremost, moving objects into the cosmo would cost an incredible amount of money, estimating to be around 1200 to 5000 USD per
kg of materials. As a result, we may not have enough finicial resources to migrate enough resources to another planet for future generations.
Also, despite the potential, no significant cosmo bodies are confirmed to be able to host life, making it extremely futile for researchers to focus
on the matter.
In conclusion, although there are mixed opinions on determining whether researching about the habilitability of planet is important and necessary, I believe
that it should be conducted, yet to a limited extend. While it can shed light on the cosmo and provide an option for future generations, our current technological
foundations are not sufficient to turn it into a reality
Day 19(11/3/2025):
Mobiles phones and the internet bring a lot of benefits to people nowdays. However, older people use them the least. In what aspects do mobile phones and the internet
benefit older people? How we can encourage them to use these technologies
Although a myriad(vô số) of benefits can be enjoyed by people who use mobile phones and the Internet, older people (tend to use:có xu hướng sử dụng) them more limitedly compared to other age groups.In this essay(tiểu luận),
I would explore the range of benefits that older people can experience if they rely on these technologies before proposing solutions to encourage them.
There are some major advantages when older people increase their reliance on mobile phones and the Internet.Older people are often characterized(đặc điểm đặc trưng) by lack
of physical mobility(di chuyển), making it hard for them to travel and have direct interactions(tương tác) with the other members in their families or friends
.This can lead to social isolation(cách ly) and eventually other mental(tâm thần) health disoders(rối loạn).With the connectivity of mobiles phones and the Internet 
, older people can connect easily with their loved(người thân yêu) ones, helping them sustain(duy trì) relationships and directly benefit their mental health
.When older people use phones and the Internet, they can keep in touch with other members in their families better
People of older ages tend to have a higher frequency(thường xuyên) of chronic(mãn tính) medical problems, such as diabetes(bệnh tiểu đường), cardiovascular(tim mạch) diseases, or hypertension(tăng huyết áp),
which need to be monitored(giám sát) consistently(nhất quán) for optimal(tối ưu) treatment(điều trị). Unfortunately, older people tend to be more physically limited in terms Of
mobility, making it hard for them to make frequent visit to medical facilities(cơ sở). Thus(do đó), when they can use the Internet and mobile phones, 
they can (get access to: tiếp cận dịch vụ) telemedical services, helping them supersive(giám sát) their health and provide them support without having to travel
.When older people use mobile phones and the Internet,they can enjoy telemedicine service
Educational solutions : The goverment should organize educational campaigns(chiến dịch) that promote(khuyến khích) the benefits of technological advancements among the group of older people. By encouraging
them to use and experience benefits, future generations can follow the step and create a larger reliance on technology
Financial incentives(khuyến khích): The goverment should subsidize(trợ cấp) the cost of technical devices, such as smartphones, as well as the Internet fee for older people, helping them increase their usage(cách sử dụng)
In conclusion, despite the benefits of mobile phones and the Internet, older people tend to hesitant(do dự) of using them. As these technologies can help older people's mental and physical health,
the goverment should implement measures that boost(thúc đẩy) the overall usage by educating about the potential benefits and providing discounts(chiết khấu) that can incentivize older people to use them

Topic: Nowdays,people always trơ old things away and buy new things, whereas in the past, old thing were repaired and used again. What factors caused this phenomenon, What effects dóe the phenomenon leadto?
In this day and age, discarding(loại bỏ) used items and purchasing new replacements has become a prevalent(phổ biến) approach(tiếp cận), whereas in the past, people were more likely to repair and reuse old items. This essay will explore the causes behind this modern behavior before discussing its implications(hàm ý).
Several factors contribute to this phenomenon(hiện tượng). Nowadays, products are manufactured(được sản xuất) at an increasingly fast pace(tốc độ), meaning that within a short period, multiple updates or new versions of the same product are introduced(giới thiệu). Additionally, advertisements aggressively(một cách hung hăng) promote(khuyến khích) new products, making consumers feel the urge(thúc giục) to replace their current items. As a result, whenever something breaks(hư hỏng), people tend to buy a new one rather than attempt(nỗ lực) to repair it.
Furthermore, many companies today implement a strategy(chiến lược) known as planned obsolescence(lỗi thời), where products are intentionally designed to be difficult or costly to repair, or even to deteriorate(xấu đi) faster over time. For instance, smartphones often experience reduced battery life and more erratic(thất thường) performance after installing new updates, forcing(bắt buộc) users to purchase replacements. The rise of fast-fashion brands has also contributed to this trend, as they produce a myriad of new clothing options in a short time, but these garments(quần áo) are generally of low quality and do not last long.
The increasing tendency to discard(loại bỏ) products rather than repair them has led to several detrimental(bất lợi) consequences. Many discarded products contain plastics and other non-biodegradable(ko phân hủy) materials, which take a long time to decompose(phân hủy), causing severe(nghiêm trọng) environmental pollution. This is particularly concerning in marine ecosystems, where waste disrupts(phá vỡ làm gián đoạn) habitats and endangers wildlife. Additionally, plastics can break down into microscopic(vi mô) particles that eventually enter the human body, leading to unpredictable(khó lường) health problems.
In conclusion, as people continue to throw away products instead of repairing and reusing them, environmental concerns(mối quan tâm) are growing. This habit not only contributes to pollution and ecological(sinh thái) destruction but also (poses risks:gây rủi ro) to human health. (Addressing this issue: giải quyết vấn đề này) requires raising awareness about sustainable(bền vững) consumption(tiêu dùng) and encouraging businesses to adopt(sản xuất) more eco-friendly production methods.
Day 21(15/3/2025):
Young people are leaving their homes from rural areas to study or work in the cities.What are the reasons? Do the advantages of this development outweight its disadvantages?
Opening: Leaving homes from remote locations to pursue work or education in the cities has become a prevalent choice of many young inviduals. In this essay, I would
explore the reson behind this development before proposing whether it has more
benefits than drawbacks.
There are some reaons that explain why young people are moving from rural to urban areas to work or study.Urban areas are characterized by vibrant economic activities
and a higher demand for educational quality. As a result, these areas offer a wide range of employment opportunities, attracting young people who are seeking for jobs.
Furthermore, perstigious and highly developed schools in urban areas also enhance the attractiveness of cities by providing chances for young people to improve themselves
academically.Urban areas are generally major economic hubs of a nation
meaning that large companies often locate in its proximity. As these huge businesses have a strong demand for human resources, young people are attracted to cities for these
opportunities.In cities, the education system is generally better, so people would want to move there to learn. Additionally, there are a lot of employment opportunities in large cities, so people want to move there so they can increase
their chance of having a job.
In rural areas, the lack of education and employmentmay lead to a waste of talent. As a result, this development may improve the utilization of human resources
leading to a better economic and societal development. Although this migration pattern may intensify environmental pollution in large cities, the benefits are more
pronounced as people's living standard is the most important factor.The reason is rooted in the professional and educational opportunities of urban regions
.I believe that there are more benefits associated with this development as it can enhance people's living standard and fuel socieltal development
Day 23(20/3/2025):
In many countries people need to leave their families and friends to find jobs in other place.Do you think the advantages outweight the disadvantages?
In a large number of nations around the world, leaving families and friends to seek=pursue(theo duoi) employment opportunities(jobs) in other places has become a popular choice
of many people.In this essay, not only would the benefits and drawbacks of this development be explored, but there also is a conclusion on which side is more prominent(noi bat)
Advantages:When people migrate to other locations, There are some major benefit associated with the development that is mentioned in the opening.
When people from a nation gradually move to other regions or even countries to work, they create multiple forms of diaspora, which can help strengthen the economic
conditions of their home nations. By learning and using new techniques, knowledge, and skills at a different country, inviduals can help form transnational economic centers
and provide conditions for the economy to progress. When people move ti urban center or a developed region, they can engage in better job opportunities, helping them earn more money. This amount of resources can help them develop themselves
better while providing remittances that can sustain their familymenbers living in their homeland/When people mote to another urban areas or even international locations, the primarily want to have better employment prospects, which can help them earn
money and send back home. By using these remittances, many families in developing countries can improve their conditions of living, helpiing them develop further
Disadvantages: It is very important for all people to be supported by a strong social network, which can help them overcome challenges in their lives. However,the eventual
family separation caused by their decision to move away directly takes away this supportive network, making them susceptible(ton thuong) to mental health and social isolation(chia cat) that 
eventually causes many mental disorders, such as anxiety and depression. One of the most important factors that help a nation develop is their ability to use technology
in all aspects of the economy. Unfortunately, when people move away to work, a lot of them are talented inviduals, who should be the main force behind
a nation's technological revolation. Thus, this form of brain drain can jeopardize(pha hoai) the developments of nation, leading to many other societal problems
In conclusion, a lot of people decide to live at a distance from their families and friends in their pursuits towards better career trajectories. Although
there are benefits regarding remittances and a potential improvement in living quaility. I believe that the drawbacks are highly prominent. Not only would a person
be prone to mental illnesses, but the problem of brain drain can also be devastating to the economy of developing nations.
